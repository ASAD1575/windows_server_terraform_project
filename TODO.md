# TODO List for CloudWatch Agent Configuration Improvements

## Completed Tasks
- [x] Add cloned_instance_count variable to modules/cloudwatch/variables.tf
- [x] Update modules/cloudwatch/main.tf to create multiple log streams for cloned instances using count
- [x] Add user_data to modules/cloned_instance/main.tf to configure CloudWatch agent with appropriate log group/stream names
- [x] Update main.tf to pass cloned_instance_count to the cloudwatch module

## Next Steps
- [ ] Run `terraform plan` to validate the changes
- [ ] Apply the changes with `terraform apply`
- [ ] Verify that CloudWatch logs are being sent correctly from both base and cloned instances
- [ ] Test with multiple cloned instances to ensure separate log streams
